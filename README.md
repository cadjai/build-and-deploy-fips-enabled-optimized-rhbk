## RHBK Opetimized Container Image Build and deployment Automation

The new release of Red Hat Build of Keycloak (RHBK) the new name for what was fomerly known as RHSSO has been simplified and above all support FIPS. 
However, due to licensing incompatibilities, Red Hat was not able to include the required Bouncy Casttle FIPS crypto libraries into the container. Instead Red Hat recommends that anyone needing strict FIPS support to rebuild the provided container to add the required libraries (jars) to be downloaded from the (BouncyCastle website)[https://bouncycastle.org/fips-java/] and specifically (from) [https://downloads.bouncycastle.org/fips-java/].

Also the approach used with RHBK is to enable more immutability and therefore the way extensions were previously done no longer works. The recommended apporach is therefore to also build the provided image to include any extensions (e.g. custom themes, spi ...) to the image. 
In order to achieve two goals with one stone we are building the image so that we can include both the BouncyCastle required libraries for FIPS as well as the custom themes/extension jars used to further customize the deployment of keycloak. 

Another change introduced with this new release is to no longer include the database deployment with the keycloak deployment. Rather it is rightly recommended that production grade database be used. 

Finally the new release provides a tons of configuration knobs to build and deploy the resulting keycloak instance. In order make it easy for folks to get started without having to comb through the extensive documentation we see the need to provide a production ready template that can be used as a starting point. 

For all of the reason above the role is being created to not only help create an optimized FIPS ready version of the container image but also a jinja2 template along with an Ansible playbook that can be used to create and configure all necessary kubernetes artifacts needed to successful deploy the resulting optimized image.

Role Name
=========

A utility role to help build and deploy an optimized Red Hat Build of Keycloak (RHBK) to be deployed via the rhbk-operator to an OpenShift Container Platform 4.+ (OCP4). 

The main focus for this role is twofolds like stated above: build an optimized image that is strict FIPS compliant and enable an easy deployment of the resulting instance based on a provided jinja2 template. 

The container build process allows for the addition of custom themes or additional libraries (e.g. extra providers to be deployed ...). 

The reason for the first focus (optimized container build) is to show how one can successfully include Bouncy Castle FIPS jars so that the optimized image can be run in strict FIPS mode. Note that even though the recommended jars are included here the playbook provide tasks to enable downloading those jars directly from the Bouncy Castle website if necessary.  In addition if extra java libraries or jars need to be included they can be placed under the context/_build/extension directory to be copied into the resulting optimized image.  

The reason for the second focus (deployment of the keycloak instance) is to make it easy to generate the necessary CR along with any needed kubernetes artifacts as well as anything required to make FIPS compliance. 

Therefore this role contains two playbooks focus on each of the main tasks: building an optimized container image and deploying the resulting keycloak instance. 

### RHBK Optimized FIPS image build
The playbook (build-optimized-rhbk-container-image.yml) and associated files allow us to build a new version of the RHBK image when a new version of the base imageis available from Red hat or whenever an update is needed (e.g. new package is required, new binaries need to be included ...). 

This playbook is used to build, tag and push two container images into the target registry. The first image is the optimized RHBK image that will be ready to support strict mode FIPS but also any additional extensions if applicable. The second image is a helper image to help create BCFKS formatted keystore and trustore from scratch using pem certificate, key and intermediate CA certificate or convert an existing JKS keystore/truststore into a BCFKS keystore/truststore. 
Note that nothing else is required for the two images to be created and pushed to the target registry except when necessary to change the base image used.  

Before running this playbook you will need the extensions either already staged or you will need to the download_extensions boolean to true to have the playbook download the extensions for you. 

This playbook can only be run on an Internet connected bastion host with access to the location where the extensions are hosted. If not please ensure you can download the exisiting extensions from the binary repository (e.g. artifactory) and stage them appropriately (the extension binaries are expected under context/_build/extensions directory). 

Once the extensions have been staged or you have updated the rhbkbuild.yml variable file to ensure that the extensions will be downloaded, you need to make sure that you also update any necessary artifacts. For example if additional changes are required to the java.security file included under the context/_build directory to reflect your intent.
 
Once all of that is done, run the playbook as follows: 

```bash 
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass -v  build-optimized-rhbk-container-image.yml
``` 
To override the default container image name, use the following command   
```bash
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass -v -e download_extensions=false -e rhbk_image_name=fips-keycloak-rhel9 build-optimized-rhbk-container-image.yml 
```

### RHBK Instance deployment 
The second playbook deploy-and-configure-rhbk-keycloak.yml is used to deploy the optimized image. 
This playbook has blocks of tasks to help with the various aspects of succesfully deploying a keycloak instance. For instance if this is for a test deployment, there is a toggle to enable the deployment of postgresql statefulset to use as the required database. Note that for production deployments this database should not be used. There are also blocks to help create keystores and truststores as well as create associated secrets and configmap if necessary, all driven by toggle booleans. There is also tasks to import realms into the deployed instance of keycloak either during startup (when running in dev mode) or post container creation. 

Like in the case above ensure that the appropriate variables have been updated to reflect your intent.

Once all of that is done, run the playbook as follows: 

```bash 
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass -v deploy-and-configure-rhbk-keycloak.yml 
``` 

Note that before running any playbook always make sure you properly set the appropriate variables as well as any related vaulted items. 

Requirements
------------
A running OpenShift 4 cluster with the rhbk-operator already deployed and with valid credentials provided through the variables described below.
A running target registry with valid credentials provided through the variables described below.
An optional RHEL 8 Internet connected bastion host with access to the location where the extensions are hosted and access to Red Hat registry if the extensions and images are to be downloaded. If there is no need to download the image or Bouncy Castle java libraries (it is assumed that these are already available on the host of can be pulled down from the target registry) then the controler does not need to be Internet Connnected. Finally the controller is expected to have few packages installed on it like podman, skopeo, jq...It is also expected to be FIPS enabled so that the built optimized image can inherit FIPS from the host it is built on. 

Dependencies
------------
This role uses the https://github.com/cadjai/ocp-cluster-login.git role to authenticate against the cluster.


Installation and Usage
-----------------------
Clone the repository to where you want to run this from and make sure you can connect to your cluster using the CLI .
Ensure you install all requirements using `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --force` before performing the next steps.
You will also need to have admin role within the namespace you are deploying into in order to run the deployment playbook.
Finally before running the playbook make sure to set and update the variables as appropriate to your use case.
